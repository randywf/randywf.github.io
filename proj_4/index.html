  <h1>Social Dominance Relationships Among Female Asian Elephants</h1>

  <div class="intro">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class="text">
      Both African and Asian elephants display social dominance over one other but there are differences that arise from their respective habitats and biology. The behaviors of female Asian elephants in particular are less understood. Over a period of 206 days, a group of researchers recorded the behaviors of these elephants.

  <div class="hyp">
    <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
    <p class="text">
      I predict that the network will be sparse and that there will not be one elephant that is dominant over all the others.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout this social network, there were not many dominance displays that were recorded by the researchers. That is clear from the visualization because there are not many edges. This supports my hypothesis that this is a sparse network. Consequently, female Asian elephants do not appear to engage in many dominance displays.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there are a few elephants that have high degrees in this graph, up to four or five. This could indicate that there are indeed a select few elephants that are dominant over the rest.
